# Project Overview

Petro Map is an interactive web application that allows users to view, search, and save the locations of gas stations on a map. <br/>
The app is built using ReactJS for a modern and responsive user interface, MongoDB to store gas station information (such as name, address, coordinates, and update time), <br/>
and Leaflet to render an interactive map with clickable location markers. Key features include displaying gas stations on the map, adding/editing/deleting locations (with permissions), <br/>
searching for nearby stations, and storing data in real-time with MongoDB.
